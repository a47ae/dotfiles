# Dotfiles
These are my dotfiles currently in use.
They are managed with [Gnu Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) making it easy for other people to use them.

# Usage
Just clone this repository to your home directory, `cd` into it and run `stow <programm name>` to create the necessary symlinks.
For example to apply my i3 config run `stow i3` from inside the dotfiles directory.

# Current setup
Currently I use Arch Linux with [i3-gaps](https://github.com/Airblader/i3) as my window manager, [compton](https://github.com/chjj/compton) as composition manager, [rofi](https://github.com/DaveDavenport/rofi) as launcher, [polybar](https://github.com/jaagr/polybar) as status bar and [dunst](http://knopwob.org/dunst/index.html) as notification deamon.
